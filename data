Phase 1: The Core Experience (The "Chat")
ID
User Story
Acceptance Criteria
1.1
As a Landlord, I want to post a rental offer instantly without an account, so I can find a tenant without filling out forms.
• Text area limited to 280 characters.

• "Post" button sends message via WebSocket.

• No login or OTP required.
1.2
As a Renter, I want to post a "Room Wanted" request, so landlords can reach out to me directly.
• Message appears in the "Requested" tab.

• Distinct styling from "Offered" posts.
1.3
As a User, I want to switch between "Offered" and "Requested" tabs instantly, so I can see the side of the market I care about.
• React-state handled tab switching (zero page reload).

• Real-time updates only for the active tab to save bandwidth.
1.4
As a User, I want to see new messages appear in real-time, so I don't have to refresh the page to find the latest deals.
• Rust backend broadcasts new messages to all connected React clients via WebSockets immediately.

Phase 2: The "Invisible" Security (The "Guardrail")
ID
User Story
Acceptance Criteria
2.1
As a System, I want to generate a unique Device ID for every visitor, so I can track behavior without a login.
• Rust backend uses browser headers/fingerprinting to assign a unique identifier.

• Identifier is stored in a secure cookie or local storage.
2.2
As a System, I want to enforce a 60-second timeout per device, so that bots cannot flood the chat.
• Redis tracks the timestamp of the last post for each Device ID.

• Rust backend rejects posts if currentTime - lastPost < 60s.
2.3
As a User, I want to see a countdown timer after I post, so I know exactly when I can send my next message.
• Frontend displays a visual 60s cooldown timer synchronized with the server's rate-limit.
2.4
As a System, I want to "Shadowban" suspicious devices, so scammers think they are posting while the community sees nothing.
• Rust backend flags specific Device IDs.

• Messages from flagged IDs are only sent back to the sender, not the global broadcast.

Phase 3: Interaction & Housekeeping (The "Utility")
ID
User Story
Acceptance Criteria
3.1
As a User, I want to click a "Contact" button that opens WhatsApp, so I can talk to the poster without their phone number being easily scraped by bots.
• Post includes a hidden phone number field.

• Clicking "Message" triggers a wa.me redirect via the backend.
3.2
As a System, I want to auto-delete messages after 48 hours, so the feed remains "fresh" and the database stays small.
• Redis TTL (Time-to-Live) is set to 172,800 seconds on every post.

• Data is automatically purged by the system.
3.3
As a User, I want to report a message for being a scam, so I can help clean the platform.
• Each post has a "Report" icon.

• If a post hits 3 unique reports (from 3 unique Device IDs), it is automatically hidden.
3.4
As a System, I want to filter messages for blacklisted keywords (e.g., "bank transfer," "gift card"), so common scams are blocked before they go live.
• Rust backend runs a regex check on every incoming string against a blacklist stored in memory.
