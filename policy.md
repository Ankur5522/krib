Role: Specialist in Indian Cyber Law and DPDP Act Compliance. Objective: Generate a Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and a Grievance Redressal page for my Indian startup, RoomShout.

Project Context: A no-login rental chat platform. We collect IP addresses and browser fingerprints for security (fraud prevention). Posts are auto-deleted after 48 hours.

Specific Requirements for India:

1. Terms of Service (IT Act, 2000 & Rules 2021):

Intermediary Status: Explicitly state that RoomShout is an 'Intermediary' under Section 79 of the IT Act, 2000. This gives us 'Safe Harbor' protection from liability for user-generated content.

Prohibited Content (Rule 3(1)(b)): Include the mandatory Indian list of prohibited content (e.g., content that is defamatory, obscene, invasive of privacy, promoting money laundering, or threatening the unity/integrity of India).

WhatsApp Handoff: Clarify that RoomShout does not verify landlords and is not a "Real Estate Agent" under RERA. We are purely a communication link.

2. Privacy Policy (DPDP Act, 2023):

Notice & Consent: Draft a "Notice" section explaining that by using the site, the 'Data Principal' (user) consents to the collection of digital identifiers (IP/Fingerprint) strictly for 'Specified Purposes' (security).

Data Minimization & Erasure: Highlight our 48-hour auto-deletion policy as a commitment to the DPDP principle of 'Storage Limitation'.

Data Localization: State that all personal data is stored on servers compliant with Indian data localization norms.

3. Grievance Redressal (Mandatory):

Create a placeholder for a Grievance Officer (Name, Email, and Address). Mention that complaints will be acknowledged within 24 hours and resolved within 15 days, as per Indian Law.

4. Safety Disclaimer:

Generate a "Public Interest" warning in English and Hinglish (e.g., "Stay Safe: Kabhi bhi room dekhne se pehle security deposit na dein") to help Indian users avoid common UPI scams.

Task: Provide the full text for Privacy.tsx, Terms.tsx, and a Safety.tsx component.
